      <h2>COFFEE COVID CHEER</h2> 
      As the novel coronavirus sweeps the globe, countries around the globe watch as COVID-19 cases and coffee consumption influence their happiness rankings. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>What inspired 3 C's?</h2>
    
      <p>
        A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"><b>2023 TJHSST study*</b></a> found astounding correlations between coffee consumption, COVID-19 cases, and happiness levels for countries around the globe on planet Earth. 
        <ul>
          <li>Those who drink coffee are 13% less likely to transmit COVID-19 to others. </li>
          <li>Having COVID-19 makes one half as likely to discuss happiness with others.</li>
          <li>Living near a coffee shop makes an individual 2.6 times as likely to accidentally leave their mask in their car. </li>
          <li>63% of coffee drinkers happily drink caramel macchiatos.</li>
          <li>Dr. Fauci is experimenting with coffee beans in the production of his next happiness vaccine. </li>
          
          
        </ul>
      </p>
  
   <h2>What does 3 C's do?</h2>
    <p>3 C's is a website that connects COVID-19, coffee, and cheerfulness. Using machine learning techniques, we find a correlation between 
        <ul>
          <li>the amount of coffee consumed by a country</li>
          <li>the prevalance of COVID-19 in a country</li>
          <li>& happiness rankings in a country.</li>
          
          
        </ul>
    </p>
    
         
    <h2 id="demo">Estimate a Country's Happiness Ranking</h2>
      <p>
        <!--change this later!--->
      With scikit-learnâ€™s DecisionTreeRegressor, our project predicts a country's "cheer" (happiness) on a scale from 2.9-7.63 given two features: 
        coffee consumption (in thousand 60-kg bags), 
        positive COVID tests/total COVID Tests %
      The output prediction is presented on our website along 
      with a graph plotting mental fatigue score vs. burn rate. </p>

    <div class="settings" id="demo-content">
      
      <div class="input-container formula">
        <b id="centerThis">Coffee Consumption: </b> <input name = "input_coffee" type="number"> <br> <br>    
        <b id="centerThis">Positive COVID Tests/Total COVID Tests %: </b> <input name  = "input_pt" type="number"><br><br>
      </div>

    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
  <!--change this later!--->
      <p>
        We used <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide?select=domestic-consumption.csv><b>ICO's Coffee Dataset</b></a>, 
        which contains data collected about the consumption of coffee in thousand 60 kilogram bags per country. 
        We also used <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/skylord/covid19-tests-conducted-by-country><b>OurWorldInData's COVID-19 dataset</b> </a> for the number of positive COVID-19 cases per country.
        Lastly, we used <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021?fbclid=IwAR3I5qZ6f7-1FSrkhapd5CcN-Va_iN80KIjlW9oyn8-d3u0z04GYJV1PFzU&select=world-happiness-report-2021.csv><b>World Happiness Report 2021</b></a> and
        <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/njlow1202/world-happiness-report-data-2018><b>the World Happiness Report 2018</b> </a>for information about how each country scores in keeping its citizens happy
        Take a look at what happens behind-the-screen:

        <ol>
          <li>We treat this data as our training data, and use it train a decision tree regressor, a type of machine learning algorithm.
            Check out more about Scikit-learn's awesome <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor"> decision tree regressors.</a></li>
          <li>Next, we read in the user's two input parameters: Coffee Consumption, Positive/Tested % (i.e. percent of total tests which are positive for COVID-19) </li>
          <li>Then to generate a prediction of this country's happiness, we put these inputs into the decision tree, which hands us back its best prediction. </li>
          <li>And all that's left is to display the result to the webpage!</li>
        </ol>
