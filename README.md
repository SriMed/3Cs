A coffee a day makes the COVID go away! Learn how your country's coffee consumption and COVID-19 infection rates affect nation-wide happiness. 

With scikit-learnâ€™s `DecisionTreeRegressor`, our project predicts a country's "cheer" (happiness) on a scale from 2.9-7.63 given two features: coffee consumption (in thousand 60-kg bags), positive COVID tests/total COVID Tests %

Special thanks to the open-source datasets we used: [ICO's Coffee Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/ico-coffee-dataset-worldwide?select=domestic-consumption.csv) for the consumption of coffee (in thousand 60 kilogram bags) per country, [OurWorldInData's COVID-19 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/skylord/covid19-tests-conducted-by-country) for the number of positive COVID-19 cases per country (% positive/total tested), [the World Happiness Report 2018](https://www.kaggle.com/njlow1202/world-happiness-report-data-2018) for information about how each country scores in keeping its citizens happy on a scale of 2.9-7.63, and the [World Happiness Report 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021?fbclid=IwAR3I5qZ6f7-1FSrkhapd5CcN-Va_iN80KIjlW9oyn8-d3u0z04GYJV1PFzU&select=world-happiness-report-2021.csv) which does the same on a scale from 2.52-7.84.
